Compilation from source
-----------------------

You need the GNU packages automake and libtool installed in your system
to compile 00mnik.

1. Run the script

./auto_init.sh

to create all supporting files of autotools.


2.  ./configure

to create the Makefile.


3. make

to compile.


To get back to the bare source distribution you can run
the "auto_cleanup.sh" script to remove the autotools files.
