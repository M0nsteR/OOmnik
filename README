00mnik Conceptual Processor
===========================

This directory contains the source code distribution of 
the  00mnik Conceptual Processor,  an advanced system
of decoding,  parsing,  and semantic interpretation of 
linear sequences of codes,  primarily the statements 
produced by natural languages.

The implementation is based on the theoretical assumptions
of the 'Concept<->Code Model' developed by Dmitri Dmitriev.

The name *00mnik* comes from Russian, where it means 
'the Smart One', mostly used in an ironic sense. ;))  
00mnik will do its best to understand the meaning 
of your input and hopefully will learn from you!

Have fun!
